# ImageJ-Processing-Assistant-Notebook
-under development-
I.P.A.N. consist of a series of ready-to-use Jupyter Notebooks for performing image analysis. This repository includes analytic pipelines to carry on some of the most requested tasks in the biomedical research field. 

For carrying out image analysis we are using the ImageJ software as a library from the Jupyter Notebook coded with Python. This notebook follows the guideline of PyImageJ (https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej). 

Main advantages of this working method are:
- performing the all analysis on one single platform,
- standardize the analysis workflow
- combine the ImageJ functionalities with Python tools and packages

Examples for the installation and initialization of ImageJ are already available (https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej/tree/master/doc).
