# ImageJ-Processing-Assistant-Notebook
-under development-

I.P.A.N. consist of a series of ready-to-use Jupyter Notebooks for performing image analysis. This repository includes analytic pipelines to carry on some of the most requested tasks in the biomedical research field. 

For carrying out image analysis we are using the ImageJ software as a library from the Jupyter Notebook coded with Python. This notebook follows the guideline of PyImageJ (https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej). 

Main advantages of this working method are:
- performing the all analysis on one single platform,
- standardize the analysis workflow
- combine the ImageJ functionalities with Python tools and packages

Examples for the installation and initialization of ImageJ are already available here: https://github.com/imagej/pyimagej/tree/master/doc.

The IPAN project is devided in multiple notebooks. 
The first one available is the "00 - introduction" that shows:
- how to open an image (different options and purposes)
- how to run a ImageJ Macro from JN 
- How to save results/pictures from the Macro
